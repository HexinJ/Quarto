# Quarto
Quarto is a fun boardgame between two players. The game uses a 4x4 board with 16 pieces. Each piece has 4 attributes: short or tall, round or square, dark or light, and dotted or not dotted. The goal is to have a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line with pieces of at least one same attribute. I have made a Greenfoot project with UI for Quarto, and have uploaded it to my school's website.

## Rules:
Each player chooses one piece and places the piece on a spot on the board. Have fun playing it with your friends!
